# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
This is a network intrusion detection system developed using Machine Learning. It detects the anomaly in the network.

# Problem Statment :
The most common risk to a networkâ€™s security is an intrusion such as brute force, denial of service, or even an infiltration from within a network. With the changing patterns in network behavior, it is necessary to switch to a dynamic approach to detect and prevent such intrusions. 

# Solution :
Intrusion detection system (IDS) is hardware or software monitor that analyzes data to detect any attack toward a system or a network. Traditional intrusion detection system techniques make the system more complex and less efficient when dealing with Big Data, because its analysis properties process is complex and take a long time.

Decision Tree machine learning algorithm is used on NSL-KDD dataset for detecting the anomaly in the network.
