# HACK-EYE (Network-Intrusion-Detection-System)
This is a project developed during the [**Infosys Summer of Ideas, 2020**](https://www.infosys.com/summerofideas.html) under the theme **Cyber Security**. This project is a network intrusion detection system developed using Machine Learning. It detects the anomaly intrusions in the network.


## Team Name : CS 33 (CRUSADERS)

4. Palisetty Greeshma Naga Lakshmi 
5. Shiva mandela  


## Problem Statment :
The most common risk to a networkâ€™s security is an intrusion such as brute force, denial of service, or even an infiltration from within a network. With the changing patterns in network behavior, it is necessary to switch to a dynamic approach to detect and prevent such intrusions. 


## Solution :
Intrusion detection system (IDS) using Machine learning monitors network traffic for anomalous activities and issue alert in case of anomaly. As network behaviours and patterns change and intrusions evolve, the network IDS continuously monitor the network in dynamically changing datasets which not only reflect the traffic compositions and intrusions of that time, but are modifiable and extensible. So, our solution detects the anomaly and can be used as backend in profession softwares to detect anomalies and alert users and stay them safe.

**Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier** machine learning algorithm is used on NSL-KDD dataset for detecting the anomaly in the network.
